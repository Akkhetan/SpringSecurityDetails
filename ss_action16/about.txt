# Added the CSRF token to the request through the form.
# Disable csrf protection for particular endpoint

An easy way to do this is to use a hidden input component, as in the default form login.

In the example, we use Thymeleaf because it provides a straightforward way to obtain the request attribute value in the view.
In our case, we need to print the CSRF token. Remember that the CsrfFilter adds the value of the token in the _csrf attribute of the request. Itâ€™s not mandatory to do this with Thymeleaf.
