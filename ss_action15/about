Call the POST endpoint without disabling CSRF protection.

Need to obtain the CSRF token so that you can use it in the header of the call, which you do with HTTP POST.

for passing from postman in header :
Use 'X-CSRF-TOKEN' as key.
Take value which you get from Spring security printed in logs via CsrfTokenLogger class
